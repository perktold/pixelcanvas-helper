# pixelcanvas-helper
pixelcanvas.io is a website, where you can draw pixelart on a shared canvas. I made a little program to bookmark my favourite drawings and re-visit them if I want.

## commands
the commands are:
+ new to bookmark a new drawing
+ del to delete a bookmark
+ goto to visit a bookmarked drawing
+ exit to save the bookmarks to a file and exit
